# master-thesis

I think it makes sense to share my code and any interesting findings that result from my Master Thesis work at TUM.

## Installation 

Install Miniconda and then the environment found in this folder with

`conda env create -f environment_jero.yml`

From this folder run:

`cd mwReconstruction; pip install --editable ./`

to install the mwReconstruction project.

Similarly for the Segmentation pipeline functionalities, also from this folder:

`cd tomoSegmentPipeline; pip install --editable ./`
