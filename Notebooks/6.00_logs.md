The dataset consists of subtomograms of shape [m, s, s, s] where m is the number of Bernoulli samples and s is the subtomogram side length.

*... we do not need to create the whole dataset of Bernoulli sampled instances in advance but just enable dropout without energy scaling on the input layer and pass the copies of the input noisy images to the NN at each iteration.* 

Think how to implement:
*... data augmentation is also used in the implementation by flipping the input image horizontally, vertically and diagonally.*
